# Computer Networking - A Top Down Approach.

This repository presents my learning and reading process for the well-known book by James Kurose, Keith Ross "Computer Networking - A Top Down Approach - 8th Edition".

Each chapter is presented as a directory that contains a README file that comprimeses the notes of the chapter and any other helper videos. Also, it contains a directory which has the solutions for chapter exercises. Not all exercises will be solved in a time. It is an ongoing process.

## What Is Unique About This Textbook?

The subject of computer networking is enormously complex, involving many concepts, protocols, and technologies that are woven together in an intricate manner. To cope with this scope and complexity, many computer networking texts are often organized around the “layers” of a network architecture. With a layered organization, students can see through the complexity of computer networking—they learn about the distinct concepts and protocols in one part of the architecture while seeing the big picture of how all parts fit together. From a pedagogical perspective, our personal experience has been that such a layered approach indeed works well. Nevertheless, we have found that the traditional approach of teaching—bottom up; that is, from the physical layer toward the application layer—is not the best approach for a modern course on computer networking.
