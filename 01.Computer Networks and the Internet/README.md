# Chapter 1. Computer Networks and the Internet

## Section 1. What Is the Internet?
### Notes
 - The Internet is a computer network that interconnects billions of computing devices throughout the world. Theses are called hosts or end-systems like:
	 - Desktop computers.
	 - Linux workstations.
	 - Smartphones and Tablets.
	 - Gaming consoles.
	 - Home security systems.
	 - Watches.
 - End systems are connected together by a network of communication links and packet switches.
 -  Different links can transmit data at different rates, with the transmission rate of a link measured in bits/second.
 - Packets are the result of segmenting data and adding headers by the end-system in order to send it to the destination.
 - A packet switch takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links.
	 - Routers:: Used in the network core.
	 - Link-Layer Switches: Used in access networks.
 - The sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet from the sending end system to the receiving end system is known as a route or path through the network.
 - End systems access the Internet through Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
	 - Residential ISPs: local cable or telephone companies.
	 - Corporate ISPs.
	 - University ISPs.
 - End systems, packet switches, and other pieces of the Internet run protocols that control the sending and receiving of information within the Internet.
	 - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) 
	 - Internet Protocol (IP) 
 - Another defintion for the internet is an infrastructure that provides services to applications.
 - End systems attached to the Internet provide a socket interface that specifies how a program running on one end system asks the Internet infrastructure to deliver data to a specific destination program running on another end system.
 - A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event.

### Review Questions
 - What is the difference between a host and an end system? List several different types of end systems. Is a Web server an end system?
	 - There is no difference.
	 - End-systems include web servers, linux workstations, gaming consoles, etc.
 - The word protocol is often used to describe diplomatic relations. How does Wikipedia describe diplomatic protocol?
	 - Based on Wikipedia the defintion of protocol is commonly described as a set of international courtesy rules. These well-established and time-honored rules have made it easier for nations and people to live and work together. Part of protocol has always been the acknowledgment of the hierarchical standing of all present. Protocol rules are based on the principles of civility.
 - Why are standards important for protocols?
	 - As it enables to develop independent and interoperate systems.
