# Chapter 2.  Application Layer
## Section 1.  Principles of Network Applications
### Notes
- There is a difference between network architecture and application architecture.
- The predominant architectural paradigms are:
	- Client-Server Architecture
	- Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture
- In the client-server architecture:
	- An always-on host with fixed ip address which responding to client's requests.
	- There is no way to make two clients talk to each other.
- In P2P architecture:
	- There is not reliance on a dedicated server.
	- The users share the content in a highly decenterliazed network.
- Processes on two different end systems communicate with each other by exchanging messages across the computer network.
	- processes communicating with each other reside in the application layer of the five-layer protocol stack.
- In the context of a communication session between a pair of processes, the process that initiates the communication (that is, initially contacts the other process at the beginning of the session) is labeled as the client. The process that waits to be contacted to begin the session is the server.
- A socket is the interface between the application layer and the transport layer within a host.
- The only control that the application developer has on the transport-
layer side is:
	- the choice of transport protocol
	- perhaps the ability to fix a few transport-layer parameters such as maximum buffer and maximum segment sizes
- To identify the receiving process, two pieces of information need to be specified:
	- the address of the host
	- an identifier that specifies the receiving process in the destination host.
- The trandport-layer protocol provides services that can be categorized into:
	- reliable data transfer
	- throughput
	- timing
	- security
- The Internet (TCP/IP networks) makes two transport protocols available to applications, UDP and TCP.
- The TCP service model includes a connection-oriented service and a reliable data transfer service.
	- It also has a congestion-control mechanism.
- UDP is a lightwight transport protocol, connectionless.
	- It provides unreliable data transfer service.
- Transport Layer Security (TLS) is an application layer enhancement for the TCP layer which provides data integrity, encryption, and end-point authentication.
- An application-layer protocol defines how an application's processes, running on different end systems, pass messages to each other.
	- The type of messages.
	- The syntax of the various message types.
	- The semantics of the fields.
	- Rules for determining when and how a process sends messages and responds to messages.
### Review Questions
- List five nonproprietary Internet applications and the application-layer protocols that they use.
	- Web: HTTP
	- E-mail: SMTP
	- Multimedia Streaming: RTP
	- Remote access: TELNET
	- File transfer: FTP
- What is the difference between network architecture and application architecture?
	- From application's developer point of view, network architecture is fixed and provides certain and well defined services to the application. On the other hand, the application architecture is defined by the application developer based on the nature of the problem being solved and other considerations.
- For a communication session between a pair of processes, which process is the client and which is the server?
	- The client is considered the one who started the converstation first in this session. While the server is considered the one who has the role to respond to this conversation.
- For a P2P file-sharing application, do you agree with the statement, “There is no notion of client and server sides of a communication session”? Why or why not?
	- No. As stated in the text, all communication sessions have a client side and a server side. In a P2P file-sharing application, the peer that is receiving a file is typically the client and the peer that is sending the file is typically the server.
- What information is used by a process running on one host to identify a process running on another host?
	- It uses the information provided by the socket.
- Suppose you wanted to do a transaction from a remote client to a server as fast as possible. Would you use UDP or TCP? Why?
	- It depends on the type of the transaction as the speed is not the only limitation. If this transaction should be gruanteed to reach the other end, then the best choice is TCP. But if not, then UDP is good.
- Referring to Figure 2.4, we see that none of the applications listed in Figure 2.4 requires both no data loss and timing. Can you conceive of an application that requires no data loss and that is also highly time-sensitive?
	- network games
	- network multimedia applications with high quality requirements
	- controlling hight sensitive devices over a network
- List the four broad classes of services that a transport protocol can provide. For each of the service classes, indicate if either UDP or TCP (or both) provides such a service.
	- Reliable data transfer: TCP
	- Timing: None
	- Security: None
	- Throughput: None
- Recall that TCP can be enhanced with TLS to provide process-to-process security services, including encryption. Does TLS operate at the transport layer or the application layer? If the application developer wants TCP to be enhanced with TLS, what does the developer have to do?
	- It operated in the application layer.
	- The developer should include TSL code in order to use.
